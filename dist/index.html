          Once opening this app, you can register an account or login to an
          existing one. Once logged in the program with route you to the movie
          screen where you can see a list of movies. From here you have the
          freedom to see information from any of the following movies, edit your
          account, or logout.

        <p class="beginning-section-info">
          Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called myFlix
          based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with
          supporting documentation.

        <h2 class="beginning-section-header">Tools</h2>
        <p class="beginning-section-info">
          This project was started by building an api by using a REST
          architecture, getting all of our endpoints set up, and inputting all
          our information into MongoDB. It was written using the React library,
          styled using bootstrap, and hosted online through gh-pages.

      <div class="flex-xaxis">
        <p class="middle-section-1">
          The first step for creating a REST API is to determine which requests
          are going to be necessary while using CRUD. CRUD stands for create,
          read, update, and delete. I made a list of all the different URL
          endpoints this application was going to use and I made a table to show
          all this information along with a function per endpoint for where the
          URL will take you. Before I went any further I tested each endpoint
          with Postman.

          <h2>MongoDB</h2>
          <p>
            I linked MongoDB to my profile after creating the API within their
            application. In there I added all the movies in the collection so
            the data could later be pulled from it to be presented in the myFlix
            project. I created a user initially to test the login then later
            optimized it so when people register it sends a post request to
            MongoDB and adds their user information to the user collection.

          <h2>App structure</h2>
          <p>
            Angular is a component-based JavaScript framework that is a good fit
            for this project. This project is going to be compromised of
            components. The first ones that got set up were the registration and
            login components. These two components interact with MongoDB to
            ensure that the information is permitted and authorized. Once myFlix
            sees that you're logged in and authorized it reroutes you to a movie
            screen where you can view all the movies. Each movie panel has a few
            buttons like description, genre, & director. For example if you
            click director then it looks into the information of that movie,
            finds that director, and pulls up a model with that director's name,
            bio, and birthdate. There is also a banner at the top that will
            allow the user to view and edit their profile information with read
            and update requests.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p class="half">
          The most challenging part of this project was integrating multiple
          technologies. I had a tough time initially being able to log
          in/register any users. I would use postman to create a user to login
          with and when I checked the console I kept getting errors or that it
          was having trouble connecting through heroku and MongoDB. To get
          through this problem I had to re-read their documentation and take it
          step by step a second time and look through my code to make sure
          everything was going right. Once it was fixed I was able to fix all
          other issues by troubleshooting them through the console and seeing
          exactly where it came from. I learned a lot working through this
          project, figuring out a lot of ways to work through a lot of different
          problems.
